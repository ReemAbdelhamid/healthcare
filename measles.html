            <h3>Reasons</h3>
            <p>
                It is caused by the measles virus entering the 
                body.
                Measles is caused by the measles virus, which is spread from person to person through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also be spread by touching a surface contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.

Symptoms:
The symptoms of measles typically appear 10-14 days after exposure to the virus and may include fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and a characteristic rash that spreads from the face to the rest of the body. In some cases, measles can lead to more serious complications, such as pneumonia, encephalitis, or death.

            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                There is no specific medicine that treats 
                measles, but its symptoms can be alleviated 
                by taking some measures.
                The vaccine can be taken within 72 hours of 
                exposure to the measles virus for those who 
                have not previously been vaccinated.
                There is no specific treatment for measles, but supportive care can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. Supportive care may include getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and using over-the-counter medications to reduce fever and alleviate symptoms such as cough and congestion. In some cases, hospitalization may be necessary to manage complications such as dehydration or pneumonia.

Prevention:
The best way to prevent measles is to get vaccinated. The measles vaccine is typically given as part of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, which is recommended for everyone over the age of 12 months. In addition to vaccination, other steps that can be taken to prevent the spread of measles include washing hands frequently with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick people, and covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

Overall, measles is a serious viral infection that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. By taking steps to prevent infection, such as getting vaccinated and practicing good hygiene, it is possible to reduce the risk of contracting and spreading measles.
