            <h3>Defination</h3>
            <p>
                Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves the
gradual cessation of kidney function. The kidneys filter waste and
extra fluid from the blood, which can then be excreted in the urine.
Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid,
electrolytes and wastes to build up in the body.
In the advanced stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few
signs or symptoms. You may not realize you have kidney disease until
after the condition has progressed.
Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the
progression of kidney damage, usually by controlling its cause.
However, even controlling the cause may not prevent kidney damage
from getting worse. Chronic kidney disease may develop into renal
failure in its last stage, which is the stage that may cause death if
artificial dialysis or kidney transplantation is not performed.

            <p>
                Treat your medical conditions with the help of your doctor. If you have diseases or
conditions that increase your risk of developing kidney disease, work with your
doctor to get them under control. Consult your doctor about tests for signs of
kidney damage.
