            <h3>Defination</h3>
            <p>
                It is an acute viral infection that spreads easily 
                between humans. It attacks the respiratory
                system, where a person gets infected through 
                the nose and mouth to the lungs. It ranges 
                from mild to severe infection, and affects all 
                age groups.
                Seasonal influenza, also known as the flu, is a viral respiratory infection that typically occurs in the fall and winter months

            <h3>Reasons</h3>
            <p>
                Transmission of influenza A virus or influenza 
                B virus into the body.
                Seasonal influenza is caused by influenza viruses, which are spread from person to person through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also be spread by touching a surface contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.

            <h3>Types</h3>
            <p>
                Influenza virus (C): infects humans, and is the 
                cause of influenza infection during the year.
                Influenza virus (D): It infects livestock and 
                cannot be transmitted to humans.
                The symptoms of seasonal influenza can vary from person to person, but may include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. In some cases, seasonal influenza can lead to more serious complications, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, or sinus or ear infections.

            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                Treatment is usually rest and drinking plenty 
                of fluids only, but in some cases the doctor 
                may prescribe antiviral medications.
                Treatment for seasonal influenza typically involves supportive care to manage symptoms and antiviral medications to reduce the severity and duration of the illness. Supportive care may include getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and using over-the-counter medications to reduce fever and alleviate symptoms such as cough and congestion. Antiviral medications, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza), work by inhibiting the replication of the virus in the body and are most effective when taken within the first 48 hours of symptom onset.

Prevention:
The best way to prevent seasonal influenza is to get vaccinated each year. The flu vaccine is typically available in the fall and is recommended for everyone over the age of 6 months. In addition to getting vaccinated, other steps that can be taken to prevent the spread of influenza include washing hands frequently with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick people, and covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

Overall, seasonal influenza is a common viral infection that can cause significant illness and complications. By getting vaccinated each year and taking steps to prevent the spread of the virus, it is possible to reduce the risk of contracting and spreading seasonal influenza.
