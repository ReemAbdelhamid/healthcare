            <h3>Defination</h3>
            <p>
                AIDS is a chronic disease caused by a virus 
                called human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
                that infects and destroys CD4 cells, a type of 
                white blood cell responsible for the immune 
                system.
                AIDS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, is a condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV attacks the immune system, gradually weakening it over time and leaving the body vulnerable to infections and other diseases

            <h3>Reasons</h3>
            <p>
                do sex outside of marriage. and
                homosexual relationships.
                Use a condom if one of the spouses has the 
                disease.
                 share with others the use of syringes, 
                piercing tools, or shaving tools.
                HIV is primarily spread through sexual contact, sharing of needles or other injection drug equipment, and mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. It can also be spread through blood transfusions or organ transplants from an infected donor, although this is rare in countries where blood and organ donations are screened for HIV.

            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                There is no definitive cure for HIV; But 
                antivirals are used to discourage it.
                Overall, AIDS is a serious condition that requires ongoing medical care and management. However, with proper treatment and prevention measures, it is possible to live a full and healthy life with HIV.
                There is currently no cure for AIDS, but there are medications that can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. These medications are called antiretroviral therapy (ART), and they work by suppressing the replication of the virus in the body. ART typically involves a combination of three or more drugs, which are taken daily for the rest of the person's life. With proper treatment, people living with HIV can lead long and healthy lives and reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to others.
