            <h3>Defination</h3>
            <p>
                It is an acute hemorrhagic viral disease, 
                transmitted through the bites of infected 
                mosquitoes.
                Yellow fever is a viral infection that is primarily spread by mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical areas of South America and Africa. The virus can cause a range of symptoms, from mild flu-like illness to severe and potentially fatal disease

            <h3>Reasons</h3>
            <p>
                It is caused by a virus that is transmitted to 
                humans by mosquitoes, and this mosquito is 
                active to feed usually during the day, 
                especially at sunrise, and it also breeds inside 
                or around houses, in addition to ponds, as 
                when a female mosquito bites an infected 
                person, it absorbs the virus with the blood 
                and multiplies inside it and penetrates the 
                stomach to settle in the stomach.
                Yellow fever is caused by the yellow fever virus, which is primarily spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The virus is not spread from person to person.

Symptoms:
The symptoms of yellow fever can vary depending on the stage of the infection, but may include:

1. Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, muscle aches, and fatigue

2. Nausea and vomiting

3. Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)

4. Abdominal pain

5. Bleeding from the nose, mouth, and eyes

            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                There is currently no specific type of 
                medication to treat yellow fever, but 
                symptoms can be treated by resting, drinking 
                fluids, taking pain relievers, and medications 
                to reduce fever, while avoiding certain 
                medications such as aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as: or 
                naproxen) as they may Increased risk of 
                bleeding.
                Yellow fever is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. These tests may include blood tests to detect the virus or antibodies to the virus.
There is no specific treatment for yellow fever, but supportive care can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. Supportive care may include getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and using over-the-counter medications to reduce fever and alleviate symptoms such as nausea and pain.

Prevention:
The best way to prevent yellow fever is to get vaccinated. The yellow fever vaccine is typically recommended for people who are traveling to areas where yellow fever is endemic. Other steps that can be taken to prevent the spread of yellow fever include using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding areas with high mosquito activity.

Overall, yellow fever is a serious viral infection that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. By taking steps to prevent infection, such as getting vaccinated and protecting against mosquito bites, it is possible to reduce the risk of contracting and spreading yellow fever.
