            <h3>Defination</h3>
            <p>
                A viral disease transmitted through the bites 
                of mammals.
                The virus attacks the central nervous system 
                and then to all parts of the body.
                Rabies is a viral infection that affects the nervous system and is usually spread to humans through the bite of an infected animal, such as a dog, bat, or raccoon.

            <h3>Reasons</h3>
            <p>
                It is caused by the entry of a rabies virus 
                (recombinant virus) through the saliva, tissues 
                or body fluids of infected animals.
                Rabies is caused by the rabies virus, which is typically spread to humans through the bite of an infected animal. The virus can also be spread through contact with infected animal saliva, such as through a scratch or open wound.

Symptoms:
The symptoms of rabies can vary depending on the stage of the infection, but may include:

1. Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and muscle weakness

2. Tingling or twitching at the site of the bite or scratch

3. Agitation, confusion, or hallucinations

4. Difficulty swallowing or breathing

5. Paralysis or seizures

Once symptoms appear, rabies is almost always fatal.

            <h3>Types</h3>
            <p>
                1-Agitated rabies: causes signs of hyperactivity 
                and bizarre, aggressive behavior. Fear of water 
                or air.
                2-Paralytic rabies: It causes a gradual loss of 
                sensation, starting from the site of the bite or 
                scratch. This type also develops less 
                frequently and for a longer period than the 
                first type.

            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                Once a rabies infection is established, there's no effective treatment. 
                Though a small number of people have survived rabies, the disease usually causes death. 
                For that reason, if you think you've been exposed to rabies, you must get a series of shots to prevent the infection from taking hold.
                Treatment for rabies typically involves a series of vaccinations and immunoglobulin injections to prevent the virus from spreading throughout the body. It is important to seek medical attention immediately if you have been bitten by an animal or have had contact with an animal that may be infected with rabies. Once symptoms of rabies appear, the infection is almost always fatal.

Prevention:
The best way to prevent rabies is to avoid contact with infected animals and to get vaccinated if you are at risk of exposure, such as if you work with animals or are traveling to an area where rabies is endemic. Vaccination is also recommended for pets, such as dogs and cats, to prevent the spread of rabies.

Overall, rabies is a serious viral infection that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. By taking steps to prevent infection, such as avoiding contact with infected animals and getting vaccinated, it is possible to reduce the risk of contracting and spreading rabies.
