            <h3>Defination</h3>
            <p>
                Bronchitis or bronchitis is inflammation and alertness in the
airways responsible for entering air into the lungs. When
bronchitis occurs, the airways swell, edematous, and sputum is
produced, which is the cause of coughing.
Acute bronchitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which are the air passages that carry air to and from the lungs. It is typically caused by a viral infection, although bacterial infections and exposure to irritants can also be contributing factors.

            <h3>Reasons</h3>
            <p>
                Bronchitis is usually caused by a viral infection. Most people get
bronchitis after they have had an upper respiratory tract infection
such as a cold or the flu. In rare cases, especially acute
bronchitis, the cause may be a bacterial infection.
Bronchitis may also occur as a result of inhaling foreign
substances into the lungs, such as: smoke, or inflammation due
to food or vomit entering the lungs.

1. Viral infections: The most common cause of acute bronchitis is a viral infection, such as the common cold or flu. These infections can cause inflammation in the bronchial tubes, leading to symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.

2. Bacterial infections: While less common than viral infections, bacterial infections can also cause acute bronchitis. These infections can be more severe than viral infections and may require antibiotics to treat.

3. Environmental irritants: Exposure to environmental irritants like tobacco smoke, air pollution, or chemical fumes can also cause acute bronchitis. These irritants can damage the bronchial tubes and make them more susceptible to infection.

4. Allergies: Allergic reactions to substances like pollen, dust, or pet dander can also cause inflammation in the bronchial tubes, leading to symptoms of acute bronchitis.

5. Weakened immune system: A weakened immune system can also increase the risk of developing acute bronchitis. This can be due to factors like old age, chronic illness, or certain medications.

            <h3>Types</h3>
            <p>
                Bronchitis is classified into two types:
1. Acute bronchitis
It usually progresses rapidly and the patient feels better after two
to three weeks. Most normally healthy people who develop acute
bronchitis recover without any complications.
2. Chronic bronchitis
It is a disease that recurs and lasts for a relatively long period,
especially in smokers. Chronic bronchitis is when the patient
suffers from a cough with sputum on most days during three or
more months a year for two consecutive years.

            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                Most people can receive treatment for the symptoms that
accompany bronchitis at home, the patient should drink a
sufficient amount of fluids and it is possible to take medicines
that are sold without a prescription together with medicine to
remove sputum, but you must consult a doctor because it is not
suitable for all patients as this medicine helps Excretion of
sputum that has collected in the lungs by coughing, and lozenges
can also be used against coughing or to soothe a dry and painful
throat.
To prevent acute bronchitis, the following can be done:
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20
seconds.
Keep hand sanitizer nearby in case soap and water are not
available.
Stay current on all immunizations, including the flu shot and the
pneumonia vaccine if you're over 65 or at high risk.
Cover the mouth when coughing and stay home when sick.
Avoid smoking or exposure to other irritants, which can make
acute bronchitis worse.
