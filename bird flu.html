            <h3>Defination</h3>
            <p>
                It is a virus that infects different types of 
                domestic and migratory birds and spreads 
                among them (especially chickens, ducks and 
                other birds), as there are many different 
                strains of the avian influenza virus, and 
                although most of them do not infect humans 
                and are not usually transmitted from one 
                person to another, it is in Recently, two strains 
                of the virus caused great concern, and many 
                people from all over the world were infected 
                with it, which led to a number of deaths.
                Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is a viral infection that primarily affects birds but can occasionally infect humans. Treatment for bird flu in humans typically involves antiviral medications and supportive care

                It is through direct contact with infected birds 
                and touching them, whether they are alive or 
                dead, in addition to their droppings or 
                secretions from the eyes and respiratory trac.
                Avian influenza is not transmitted through 
                cooked poultry or eggs.

            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                It is by antiviral medication and must be taken 
                within two days after the onset of symptoms.

Antiviral medications:
Antiviral medications are the main treatment for bird flu in humans. These medications work by inhibiting the replication of the virus in the body and can help reduce the severity and duration of the illness. The specific antiviral medication used to treat bird flu may vary depending on the strain of the virus and the individual's medical history. Some common antiviral medications used to treat bird flu include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).

Supportive care:
In addition to antiviral medications, supportive care may be necessary to help manage symptoms and complications of bird flu. Supportive care may include:

1. Rest: Getting plenty of rest is important to help the body fight off the infection.

2. Fluids: Drinking plenty of fluids can help prevent dehydration and maintain hydration.

3. Oxygen therapy: In severe cases of bird flu, oxygen therapy may be necessary to help maintain adequate oxygen levels in the blood.

4. Mechanical ventilation: In rare cases, mechanical ventilation may be necessary to help a person breathe if they are experiencing respiratory failure.
