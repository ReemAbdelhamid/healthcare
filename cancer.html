            <h3>Defination</h3>
            <p>Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and
                spread to other parts of the body. Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human
                body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and
                multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body
                needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells
                take their place.
                Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells
                grow and multiply when they shouldn’t. These cells may form tumors, which are
                lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous (benign).
                Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel to distant
                places in the body to form new tumors (a process called metastasis). Cancerous
                tumors may also be called malignant tumors. Many cancers form solid tumors, but
                cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not.
                Benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. When removed,
                benign tumors usually don’t grow back, whereas cancerous tumors sometimes do.
                Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. Some can cause serious
                symptoms or be life threatening, such as benign tumors in the brain.

            <h3>Reasons</h3>
            <p>Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control
                the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.
                Genetic changes that cause cancer can happen because:
                •of errors that occur as cells divide.
                •of damage to DNA caused by harmful substances in the environment, such as
                the chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet rays from the sun. (Our Cancer
                Causes and Prevention section has more information.)
                •they were inherited from our parents.
                The body normally eliminates cells with damaged DNA before they turn
                cancerous. But the body’s ability to do so goes down as we age. This is part of the
                reason why there is a higher risk of cancer later in life.
                Each person’s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. As the cancer
                continues to grow, additional changes will occur. Even within the same tumor,
                different cells may have different genetic changes.
                The genetic changes that contribute to cancer tend to affect three main types of
                genes—proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair genes. These
                changes are sometimes called “drivers” of cancer.
                Porto-oncogenes are involved in normal cell growth and division. However, when
                these genes are altered in certain ways or are more active than normal, they may
                become cancer-causing genes (or oncogenes), allowing cells to grow and survive
                when they should not.
                Tumor suppressor genes are also involved in controlling cell growth and division.
                Cells with certain alterations in tumor suppressor genes may divide in an
                uncontrolled manner.
                DNA repair genes are involved in fixing damaged DNA. Cells with mutations in
                these genes tend to develop additional mutations in other genes and changes in
                their chromosomes, such as duplication s and deletions of chromosome parts.
                Together, these mutations may cause the cells to become cancerous.
                As scientists have learned more about the molecular changes that lead to cancer,
                they have found that certain mutations commonly occur in many types of
                cancer. Now there are many cancer treatments available that target gene
                mutations found in cancer. A few of these treatments can be used by anyone with
                a cancer that has the targeted mutation, no matter where the cancer started
                growing.
