            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>
                Pharyngitis, or sore throat, is discomfort, pain, or scratchiness in the throat. It often makes it painful to swallow.
                Sore throat is a condition characterized by pain, discomfort, or irritation in the throat, often accompanied by difficulty swallowing or talking. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including viral or bacterial infections, allergies, environmental irritants (such as smoke or pollution), dry air, and acid reflux. Symptoms of sore throat may also include swollen glands, fever, and fatigue. Treatment for sore throat depends on the underlying cause and may include rest, hydration, pain relievers, and antibiotics (in the case of a bacterial infection). In many cases, sore throat will resolve on its own within a few days without the need for medical intervention. However, if symptoms persist or are severe, it is important to seek medical advice

            <h3>Reasons</h3>
            <p>
                Pharyngitis is caused by swelling in the back of the throat (pharynx) between the tonsils and the voice box (larynx).

                Most sore throats are caused by colds, the flu, coxsackie virus or mono (mononucleosis).
                Bacteria that can cause pharyngitis in some cases:
                
                Strep throat is caused by group A streptococcus.
                Less commonly, bacterial diseases such as gonorrhea and chlamydia can cause sore throat.
                Most cases of pharyngitis occur during the colder months. The illness often spreads among family members and close contacts

            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                Most sore throats are caused by viruses. Antibiotics do not help viral sore throats. Using these medicines when they are not needed leads to antibiotics not working as well when they are needed.

                Sore throat is treated with antibiotics if:
                
                A strep test or culture is positive. Your provider cannot diagnose strep throat by symptoms or a physical exam alone.
                A culture for chlamydia or gonorrhea is positive.
                Sore throat caused by the flu (influenza) may be helped by antiviral medicines.
                
                The following tips may help your sore throat feel better:
                
                Drink soothing liquids. You can either drink warm liquids, such as lemon tea with honey, or cold liquids, such as ice water. You could also suck on a fruit-flavored ice pop.
                Gargle several times a day with warm salt water (1/2 tsp or 3 grams of salt in 1 cup or 240 milliliters of water).
                Suck on hard candies or throat lozenges. Young children should not be given these products because they can choke on them.
                Use of a cool-mist vaporizer or humidifier can moisten the air and soothe a dry and painful throat.
                Try over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen
