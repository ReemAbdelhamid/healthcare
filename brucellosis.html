            <h3>Defination</h3>
            <p>
                It is a bacterial disease caused by different 
                types of brucellosis bacteria, and it is 
                transmitted by animals directly or indirectly, 
                and often affects people working in the 
                livestock sector, as the consumption of milk 
                and cheese made from milk (fresh cheese) is 
                the main source of infection in humans, and 
                the transmission of Human-to-human 
                transmission is very rare, and brucellosis 
                remains a problem globally. Because it is the 
                most common bacterial infection from 
                animals to humans worldwide, animals may 
                carry the bacteria without showing any 
                symptoms.Brucellosis, also known as undulant fever, is a bacterial infection that is typically spread to humans by contact with infected animals or consumption of contaminated animal products.

            <h3>Reasons</h3>
            <p>
                It is caused by infection with the infectious 
                brucellosis bacteria.
                Ways of transmission:
                Drinking unpasteurized milk or its products, or 
                eating undercooked meat from infected 
                animals.
                Direct contact with infected animals or their 
                secretions (tissue, blood, urine, vaginal 
                secretions, aborted fetuses, especially the 
                placentas) through the presence of cracks in 
                the skin.
                The symptoms of brucellosis can vary widely from person to person, but may include fever, chills, sweats, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, and loss of appetite. In some cases, brucellosis can lead to more serious complications, such as inflammation of the heart or brain, arthritis, or chronic fatigue syndrome.
Brucellosis is typically diagnosed through blood tests that detect the presence of antibodies to the Brucella bacteria. In some cases, other tests, such as bone marrow culture or spinal fluid analysis, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis

            <h3>Types</h3>
            <p>
                1-Brucella maltese (melitensis): 
                It is found in sheep, and it is the most 
                widespread and the most severe.
                2-Brucellosis swine (Swiss):
                It affects those in contact with the animal and 
                is considered highly effective.
                3-Brucella abortus (Abortus):
                It is found in cows, and is considered to be of 
                medium severity.
                4-Canis brucellosis (Canis):
                affects workers with dogs and is of moderate 
                severity.
                The symptoms of brucellosis can vary widely from person to person, but may include fever, chills, sweats, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, and loss of appetite. In some cases, brucellosis can lead to more serious complications, such as inflammation of the heart or brain, arthritis, or chronic fatigue syndrome.

            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and 
                prevent complications and depends on the 
                timing and severity of the disease. It may take 
                a few weeks to several months to recover 
                from it, by taking antibiotics for at least six 
                weeks.
                Brucellosis is typically treated with a combination of antibiotics, such as doxycycline and rifampin, for a period of several weeks to several months. In some cases, other antibiotics may be used, depending on the severity of the infection and the individual's medical history. It is important to complete the entire course of antibiotics, even if symptoms improve, to prevent the infection from recurring.
The best way to prevent brucellosis is to avoid contact with infected animals or animal products. This includes wearing protective clothing when handling animals, consuming only pasteurized dairy products, and avoiding consumption of meat from infected animals. In addition, vaccination may be recommended for individuals at high risk of exposure to brucellosis.
Overall, brucellosis is a serious bacterial infection that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. By taking steps to prevent infection, such as avoiding contact with infected animals and consuming only pasteurized dairy products, it is possible to reduce the risk of contracting the disease.
